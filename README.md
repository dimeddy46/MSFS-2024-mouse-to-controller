# MSFS 2024 Mouse As Controller
This is a script written in Python that lets you use your mouse as a controller in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.\
\
Current status of the mouse yoke is shown in the top left corner of the screen.\
It also allows controlling the rudder by pressing (modifiable in config.json) the "q" key and dragging the mouse horizontally.

## How does it work?
The script is always listening for the mouse position and it transforms that into an xbox controller input. 

## Installation
1. You must have Python installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. [Download script files](https://github.com/dimeddy46/MSFS-2024-mouse-to-controller/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
3. Run the script with run.bat. A "ready" message should be displayed.
4. Import the 2 .xml profiles as shown below. If sensitivity tweaking is needed, filter the "Airplanes Controls" by Axis.
