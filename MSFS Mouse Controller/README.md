# MSFS 2024 Mouse As Controller
This is a script written in Python that lets you fly with your mouse in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.\
Status of the mouse yoke is shown in the top left corner of the screen.
It also allows controlling the rudder by pressing (modifiable in config.json) the "q" key and dragging the mouse horizontally.


## How does it work?

The script is always listening for the mouse position and it transforms that into an xbox controller input. 


## Installation

To run the script, just open the file run.bat. You must have Python installed in your computer.
